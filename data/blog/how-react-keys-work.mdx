### Why is the "key" prop needed?

The `key` prop is the only thing React can use to identify components in the DOM when they are
mapped from an array. If no `key` is provided then you will see an error like the following one:

```
Missing "key" prop for element in iterator
```

In that case, React will default to use the index of the element in the array as the key. Usually,
developers will also provide index as the key just to remove the warning.

Using the index as the key is dangerous and can lead to bugs as stated in the official React docs:

> We donâ€™t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact
> performance and may cause issues with component state.

### Why using the index as key is wrong?

The problem comes when adding, removing or modifying elements in the array. I've prepared a small component
to see the effect of using the index as key.

We have the following array:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Item A"
  },
  {
    "text": "Item B"
  },
  {
    "text": "Item C"
  }
]
```

And we are mapping it to React components using the index as the key.

```jsx
items.map((item, index) => (
  <div key={index}>
    <label>
      Index {index} - {item.text}
      <input type="text" />
    </label>
    <button onClick={removeElement}>Remove</button>
  </div>
));
```

React will identify each component with the index provided. For example, the item `A` is
identified with `index 0`.

Now try to type some text in each input of the live example below. React will store the state for each element.
After typing something in all three, remove the first component.

<ListWithIndexKey />

What happened?

The first element was removed from the array as we can see and then the second element was identified with `index 0`.
Because of this, React thinks that the first element **was not removed** because `index 0` is **still present** and the
state of the first element is now stored in the second element.

What React sees is that the element identified with `index 3` no longer exists and the state of that element was
lost.

### How to fix it?

The solution is to **use a stable unique id** as the key. React will always identify the element correctly
this way.

We've now provided a unique ID to each element in the array.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "item-a",
    "text": "Item A"
  },
  {
    "id": "item-b",
    "text": "Item B"
  },
  {
    "id": "item-c",
    "text": "Item C"
  }
]
```

And we are using it as the key.

```jsx
items.map((item, index) => (
  <div key={item.id}>
    <label>
      Index {index} - {item.text}
      <input type="text" />
    </label>
    <button onClick={removeElement}>Remove</button>
  </div>
));
```

Reproduce the same steps in the next live example. See how now React correctly handles the modification of the array.

<ListWithId />

### Conclusion

- Always try to use stable unique IDs as the key.
- The only exception when this is not needed is when the elements
  of the array are static and do not change or the order of the elements does not change.
- In case that a unique ID is not available, use the index as the key.
