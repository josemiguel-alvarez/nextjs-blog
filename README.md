# My personal blog üìù

## Description

This is my personal blog where I will be posting technical content that I've learned and that I've found interesting.

This project has been created using the [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project. It uses Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

The blog posts are stored in `/data/blog` as Markdown files with front matter support. It also supports Markdown with JSX (`.mdx` files).

## Ideas for future development

- Improve landing page
- Fetch Twitter engagement data and display it in the post
- Load comments when scrolling down

## Deployment

The project is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

- Production URL: [jmalvarez.dev](https://www.jmalvarez.dev/)
