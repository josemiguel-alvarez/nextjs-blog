# My personal blog üìù

## Description

This is my personal blog where I will be posting technical content that I've learned and that I've found interesting.

## Development process

This project has been created using the [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project. It uses Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

The blog posts are stored in `/data/blog` as Markdown files with front matter support. It also supports Markdown with JSX (`.mdx` files).
